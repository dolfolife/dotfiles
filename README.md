Warning: If you want to give these scripts a try, you should first fork this
repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t
blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own
risk!
```

- open **Terminal**, load your SSH key and run
  ```
  sudo xcodebuild -license  # follow the interactive prompts
  git clone -–depth 1 https://github.com/dolfolife/dotfiles
  cd dotfiles
  <Change Github config>
  ./install.sh
  ```

## patterns and assumptions
- Keep it simple
- Declarative and idempotent
- Install as much as possible via brew
